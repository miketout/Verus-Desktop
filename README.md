# Verus Desktop

The Verus Multicoin Wallet and Ecosystem desktop application

## Development Prerequisites

### Required Software

1) [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    - **Note:** Node.js 20.x is recommended. Node.js 22 and higher are **not supported**
2) [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
3) [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
4) [Verus CLI](https://verus.io/wallet)  (`verus` and `verusd` binaries)

### Cloning the Repository and Optional Plugins

Clone the Verus Desktop repository and the GUI submodule:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop
```

#### Optional Plugins

The [Verus Login Consent Client](https://github.com/VerusCoin/verus-login-consent-client) is needed to handle deeplinks, including login.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VerusCoin/verus-login-consent-client.git
```

The [Verus PBaaS visualizer](https://github.com/VerusCoin/verus-pbaas-visualizer) provides PBaaS network Visualizations in 3d graphs.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VerusCoin/verus-pbaas-visualizer.git
```

### Verus Desktop Setup

From the Verus Desktop directory, create the following folder structure for your operating system:

| Operating System | Path                       |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| Linux            | `assets/bin/linux64/verusd`|
| macOS            | `assets/bin/osx/verusd`    |
| Windows          | `assets/bin/win64/verusd`  |

Copy both `verus` and `verusd` binaries into the appropriate folder (e.g. `assets/bin/linux64/verusd/`).

## Running

Verus Desktop can be run without building to allow for easier development or with building to test for production before packaging the app.

**Important:** Both the GUI and the PBaaS visualizer require the `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` environment variable. This environment variable will cause an error when trying to run Verus Desktop. Make sure to use a **separate terminal** for the GUI and PBaaS visualizer.

### Development Mode (Without Building)

#### GUI

Open a new terminal in the Verus Desktop directory:
```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
cd gui/Verus-Desktop-GUI/react/
yarn install
```

You can run the GUI in two ways.

1. Without plugins:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

2. With plugins:
    ```bash
    yarn start-no-dashboard
    ```

#### Optional: PBaaS visualizer

Open a new terminal, navigate to the PBaaS visualizer directory:
```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
yarn install
yarn start
```

#### Optional: Login Consent Client 

Open a new terminal, navigate to the Login Consent Client directory:
```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

#### Desktop

With the GUI and any optional plugins running, navigate to the Verus Desktop directory:
```bash
yarn install
yarn start devmode
```

#### Debugging

- If you see a blank white window after starting the desktop application, check if the GUI is running.
- If the GUI or PBaaS visualizer fails to start and you get this error:
    
    `Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported`
    
    This indicates that the required environment variable is not set.
- If the GUI or PBaaS visualizer fails to start and you get this error:

    `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::9838`

    Then run the GUI with `yarn start-no-dashboard` to avoid dashboard conflicts.

- If you get a blank white window after trying to open the PBaaS visualizer, check if the PBaaS visualizer is running.
- If you get a smaller blank white window after using a deeplink, check if the Login Consent Client is running.

### Production Mode (With Building)

#### GUI

Open a new terminal in the Verus Desktop directory:
```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
cd gui/Verus-Desktop-GUI/react/
yarn build
```

#### Optional: PBaaS visualizer

Open a new terminal, navigate to the PBaaS visualizer directory:
```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
yarn install
yarn build
```

After building, you will find the plugin files in the `/build` directory. Create the folder `assets/plugins/builtin/verus-pbaas-visualizer/` inside your Verus Desktop directory and copy the build files into it.

#### Optional: Login Consent Client 

Open a new terminal, navigate to the Login Consent Client directory:
```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

After building, you will find the plugin files in the `/build` directory. Create the folder `assets/plugins/builtin/verus-login-consent-client/` inside your Verus Desktop directory and copy the build files into it.

#### Desktop

With the GUI and any optional plugins built, navigate to the Verus Desktop directory:
```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

#### Debugging

- If you see a blank white window after starting the desktop application, the GUI needs to be built.
- If the GUI or PBaaS visualizer fails to build and you get this error:
    
    `Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported`
    
    This indicates that the required environment variable is not set.
- If you get a blank white window after trying to open the PBaaS visualizer, the PBaaS visualizer needs to be built.
- If you get a smaller blank white window after using a deeplink, the Login Consent Client needs to be built.


## Packaging

Build all dependencies, including the GUI and any optional plugins, before packaging the application. See [Production Mode (With Building)](#production-mode-with-building) for how to build. 

Package the application:
```shell
yarn run dist
```

The packaged application will be packaged based on your operating system, and located in the `/dist` directory.
| Operating System | Output File Type |
|------------------|------------------|
| Linux            | `.AppImage`      |
| macOS            | `.dmg`           |
| Windows          | `.exe`           |
